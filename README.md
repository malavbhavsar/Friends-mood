fbhack
======
This was [@rpatwa](https://github.com/rpatwa)'s and my submission to [Pittsburgh Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/402569479796860/) organized by facebook.

It uses rails as a webframework to get the recent statuses of your facebook friends and does sentiment analysis, using a [gem](https://github.com/malavbhavsar/sentimentalizer) that I created, to tell you how are your friends feeling.

You can find this working [here](http://damp-anchorage-5339.herokuapp.com/).
